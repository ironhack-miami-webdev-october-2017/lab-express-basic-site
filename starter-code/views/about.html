  <h2>About Green Tea</h2>
  <p>Green Tea is a true tea type made using the leaves of the <i>Camellia sinensis</i> tea plant.
    It is called a true tea because it is actually made from the leaves of the plant, versus
    other herbal tea types that are made from the leaves, stems, roots and flowers of plants.

  <h3>Brewing Green Tea</h3>
  <p>There is no one way to brew green tea, however we can follow a general method for most types.
    <em>As a rule of thumb, you should aim for 2 grams of tea leaves per 6 ounces of water.</em>
    <li>Start with fresh, cold (not distilled or previously boiled) water.</li>
    <li>Allow the water to heat just short of boiling. The ideal range is between 160-180 Â°F.</li>
    <li>Let the tea steep between 1-3 minutes. Small leaves generally infuse faster than large ones.</li>
    <li>Pour and enjoy with any other sweeteners or desired flavors.</li>
