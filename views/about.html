    <h2>About Emma Watson</h2>

      <p>
        Emma Watson, in full Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson, (born April 15, 1990,
        Paris, France), British actress and activist who was perhaps best known
        for playing the young wizard Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films.
        She also garnered attention as a spokesperson for women’s equality.
      </p>

        Watson was born in Paris to British parents who divorced when she was
        young. She and her brother went to live with their mother in
        Oxfordshire, England. While a child, Watson decided she wanted to be an
        actress. Besides attending school, she took acting and singing classes.
        She also appeared in several school plays.

        Watson began acting in earnest in 1999 after she auditioned for a part
        in the film adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s
        Stone (2001). She won the role of smart and logical Hermione, one of
        Harry Potter’s best friends. The film was a box-office hit, and Watson
        reprised her role in the franchise’s other movies: Harry Potter and the
        Chamber of Secrets (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
        (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), Harry Potter and the
        Order of the Phoenix (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
        (2009), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), and Harry
        Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).
