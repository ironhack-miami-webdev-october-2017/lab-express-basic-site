    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of
      data stored on a digital ledger (blockchain).[1] NFTs can be associated
      with easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other
      types of digital files as unique items (analogous to a certificate of
      authenticity), and use blockchain technology to give the NFT a verified
      and public proof of ownership. Copies of the original file are not
      restricted to the owner of the NFT, and can be copied and shared like any
      file. The lack of interchangeability (fungibility) distinguishes NFTs from
      blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.

      The first NFT project was launched in 2015 on the Ethereum blockchain, and
      interest grew with the rise of interest in crypto currencies. Interest and
      the total monetary value of NFTs grew significantly in 2021, with sales of
      NFTs exceeding $2 billion during the first quarter of the year.

      NFTs have drawn criticism with respect to the energy cost and carbon
      footprint associated with validating blockchain transactions as well as
      its frequent use in art scams.
