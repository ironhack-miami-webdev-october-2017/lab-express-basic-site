        <p>One of the most interesting things about how Elon Musk works is the fact that he does work -- because, really, he doesn't have to. His ventures in the Internet world earned him a considerable fortune. By his early 30s, he was already worth about $200 million. But when people ask him why he hasn't retired -- or bought himself an island, for that matter -- he claims he'd simply get bored. Instead, Elon Musk decided to enter one of the riskiest, costliest, most unforgiving businesses there is: the space business.</p>

        <p>Unlike many of the other private attempts to enter space, Musk's rockets are built to enter Earth orbit or beyond, which is a bigger challenge than merely reaching suborbital heights (something SpaceShipOne accomplished). And although Musk has proven his business savvy through several successful ventures (he's linked to PayPal, for one), he's surprised everyone with his space aspirations. Not easily discouraged, he explained in one interview that people are too easily frightened by risk -- in fact, they all too often overestimate the risk involved</p>
