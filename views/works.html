        <h2>Little Women (2019)</h2>
        <p>
          Adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel about a group of sisters
          growing up after the American Civil War. Gerwig’s affection and
          respect for the book is obvious but she boldly captures the transition
          from childhood to womanhood by playing with structure; an outstanding
          cast and skilful filmmaking make it a beautifully crafted tale of
          sisterhood, memory and authorship.

        <h2>Beauty and the Beast (2017)</h2>
        <p>
          Belle (Watson) is forced to live with a Beast (Stevens) in this
          live-action retelling of the 1991 blockbuster. Watson is winsome but
          feisty, Evans as Gaston is splendid of voice and hilariously odious,
          McGregor brings much joie de vivre to ‘Be Our Guest’, and it’s an
          enchantingly realised delight.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>The Colony (2016)</h2>
        <p>
          Lufthansa flight attendant Lena (Watson) and her activist boyfriend
          Daniel (Brühl) are caught up in the 1973 Chilean military coup, and
          when he's sent to the infamous Colonia Dignidad to be tortured, she
          goes undercover to rescue him. Risible, simplistic and hopelessly
          ill-judged attempt at a socially conscious thriller, which ends up
          more like an Eli Roth-esque exploitation flick.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Regression (2015)</h2>
        <p>
          Minnesota, 1990: when teenager Angela (Watson) accuses her father
          (Dencik) of sexual abuse and he admits guilt while claiming to
          remember nothing, detective Bruce (Hawke) investigates. A sound
          premise and fine performances are let down by a disappointing and
          unsurprising script that hints at far more twists and chills than it
          delivers.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>The Bling Ring (2013)</h2>
        <p>
          Coppola's caper, based on a true story, follows a group of high school
          friends who burgle the homes of the rich and famous, spurred by their
          obsession with celebrity.

      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)</h2>
        <p>
          In a 90s American high school, Charlie (Lerman) negotiates first love
          and social strictures in the wake of a personal trauma.
          Writer/director Chbosky adapted his own novel, giving a purity of
          voice and intent to this sincere and witty drama, while Miller steals
          the show as Charlie’s new best friend.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011)</h2>
        <p>
          The end has arrived for Harry and happily the last installment really
          satisfies with its breakneck pacing, breathtaking set-pieces and a
          genuinely heart-warming ending.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2010)</h2>
        <p>
          The seventh installment of the wildly popular wizard franchise is an
          atmospheric but emotionally hollow and rather rushed take on Rowling's
          original, with a strong performance from ever-dependable Grint but
          little else to recommend it other than as an appetiser for next
          summer's grand finale.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)</h2>
        <p>
          While the sixth installment in the Harry Potter franchise does venture
          into darker, more adult areas than its predecessors it also injects
          more humour and character development than previous encounters, which
          doesn't always make for a satisfying concoction. Yates picks up in the
          aftermath of a spectacular attack on London by Death Eaters and builds
          towards the death of a key character that will pre-empt the final
          confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort in two-part finale, The
          Deathly Hallows.
        </p>

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)</h2>
        <p>
          With Harry's fifth return to Hogwarts comes the realisation that
          Voldemort's return to power is not the only factor that will trouble
          him and he is forced to confront a different force that matches his
          growing pains. Rowling's most complex and uneven book has proven to be
          the most difficult to adapt. Missing the talents of a big name
          director this still contains some enjoyable moments courtesy of
          newcomer Imelda Staunton, playing the latest Defence Against the Dark
          Arts teacher. Sadly exposition over action is this film's real
          undoing.

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</h2>
        <p>
          Harry and his mates get busy at the inter-school of magic TriWizard
          Tournament, only to be faced with the return of evil mastermind Lord
          Voldemort (Fiennes). Overlong but entertaining enough adaptation of
          fourth Potter book directed with by Brit Newell.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</h2>
        <p>
          It is the summer before Harry's third year at Hogwarts, and he has
          heard that it is Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a renegade wizard, is the
          Prisoner of Azkaban. What Harry doesn't suspect is that Black has
          escaped and is coming after him. Expectations are riding high for
          Harry Potter 3, with a new director in Cuarón (Y Tu Mamá También), and
          a darker, more complex book to adapt. There is enough dark humour,
          spectacular effects and appealing performances to keep you trapped in
          the franchise. But Harry's new adventure is also ponderous and
          overlong, regular Potter screenwriter Steven Kloves' confusing,
          rambling, structurally incoherent script, in which characters appear
          and disappear and plot turns are never realised, keeps the door firmly
          closed on this private club.
        </p>

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</h2>
        <p>
          It's the boy-wizard's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
          Wizardry where evil forces have released a vicious serpent into the
          corridors. In line with JK Rowling's book, the second film is darker
          than the first. It's perhaps somewhat over-long, but the combination
          of old-fashioned kids' storytelling and blockbuster budget special
          effects make for something more pleasing than standard Hollywood eye
          candy.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2>
        <p>
          When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a
          decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to
          know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when
          Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his
          unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts, a wizarding school brimming
          with ghosts and enchantments, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery
          when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor.
