    <h1>How do NFTs work?</h1>
    <p>
      At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain.
      Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain
      also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them
      work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other
      blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs.
